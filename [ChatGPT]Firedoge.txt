"I have a Firefox wrapper that is a Bash script, called firedoge. Resides in /usr/bin/firedoge.

It runs Firefox with "(firefox @ &)"

How this script can set its own icon and name in Gnome's System Monitor?"

You can set the icon and name of the firedoge process that appears in Gnome's System Monitor by using the --class and --icon options of the firefox command. Here's an updated version of your script that sets these options:

#!/bin/bash

# Set the name and icon of the Firefox process
firefox --class firedoge --icon /path/to/icon.png @ &

# You can replace "/path/to/icon.png" with the path to the icon you want to use.

This should make the firedoge process appear in Gnome's System Monitor with the specified name and icon. Note that the name and icon may take a few seconds to update in the System Monitor after the process starts.
